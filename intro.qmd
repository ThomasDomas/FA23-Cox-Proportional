# Introduction

## History of Cox Regression PHM

The Cox proportional hazards model (PHM) was published in 1972, it is also known as the Cox Regression or Cox PH model. The Cox regression model is an important statistical tool used primarily in survival analysis. As previously mentioned this model was developed in 1972, by a British statistician by the name of Sir David R. Cox to analyze time-to-event data. To gain a better grasph of Cox PHM, we need to initially comprehend Survival-time analysis.

## Survival Time Analysis

Survival analysis, or more generally, time-to-event analysis, refers to a set of methods for analyzing the length of time until the occurrence of a well-defined endpoint of interest (@schober2018). In other words, survival time analysis is a statistical method in which the variable of interest is studied until the time the event of interest occurs. In time-to-event analysis, there is a start time and event time (end time), and the time in between is the survival time analysis. The period of survival time can be measured in days, weeks, months, or years. A classic example as the name suggests is the "Time Until Death after an Illness". In this example, the start time is when the patient gets a disease and the end time is when a patient dies from the disease. Often these experiments test if a certain drug has an influence on survival time or not. According to D. Kumar and B. Klefsjö, proportional hazard models (PHMs) have been used to model component failure in nuclear plants, ship sonar, aircraft engines, train breaks, safety valves, aircraft doors, and power cables, among other areas ([@kumar1994]). It is important to point out that survival time analysis may not have anything to do with survival time, depending on the experiment. Another aspect of survival analysis that must be considered is when the event in question occurs after the experimental time frame or when outside factors affect the patient and in turn affect the experiment. In the example case provided earlier, the patient has an illness and the patient does not die of the illness within the time frame of the experiment or the patient might pass away due to other factors such as a car accident. In these cases, the data is considered censoring data. Cox regression differs from other survival analysis tests such as Kaplan-Meier and Log Rank analysis in the introduction of age as a factor. Cox regression is used in survival time analysis to determine the influence of different variables on survival time. Plainly stated Cox regression analysis we want to know whether survival time depends on more than one factor in addition to age. 

## Purpose of the Study

This study aims to investigate the practical application of the Cox Proportional Hazard Model (PHM) within a medical context by utilizing authentic data. Our objective is to elucidate the prevalence of COX PHM in survival-analysis research compared to alternative methodologies. Utilizing real-life data from Stanford University concerning post-heart transplant survivability, our goal is to demonstrate the efficacy of the Cox regression model.
