Let's look at the data, Image 1 best illustrates this answer. The rate
of death with no heart transplant drops significantly over time. The
number of patients who did not receive a transplant is 32, with only 2
surviving past 500 days. Patients who did receive the transplant are 67,
with more than 22 surviving past 500 days.~

In Image 2 categories patients under 40, between 40-50 and over 50 years
old and a hazard ratio of 2.08. From one category to the next this tells
us you are twice as likely to die. Not accounting for if you get the
transplant or not.

First model excluded wait time as wait time is only available for
patients who received transplant, and not all patients in the study had
the opportunity to receive a heart transplant. The C-statistic =0.747
(see \textbf{Table 1}).

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

The key question at the heart of our study revolves around a fundamental
question healthcare: does a heart transplant prolong the life of
patients? Logically, one would assume that undergoing such a significant
medical procedure, with all the risk involved and complexities, should
lead to an extended life of the individual. After all, why would
patients willingly choose to undergo heart transplants if they did not
anticipate the promise of improved survival and a better quality of
life? To address this key question, we delved into the data provided by
Stanford Heart Transplant Study, utilizing the Cox Regression model to
shed light on the matter.

Our analysis, as portrayed in Image 1, provides a compelling answer to
the question. In this graph, patients who received a heart transplant
are represented in teal, while those who did not receive a transplant
are represented in red. The important observation is the remarkable
decrease in the rate of death among those who did not undergo a heart
transplant over time. The total sample size was 99 patients, 32 of them
did not receive a transplant while 67 others did receive the heart
transplant. From the 32 who did not receive a transplant only 2 patients
managed to survive past 500 days. In stark contrast, among the 67
patients who did receive the transplant, more than 22 of them survived
beyond the 500-day mark. This visually striking contrast suggests that
heart transplantation does indeed have a significant impact on extending
the lives of patients in this context.

Image 2, on the other hand, offers a different perspective by
categorizing patients based on age groups; those under 40, those between
40 and 50, and those over 50 years old. The calculated hazard ratio of
2.08 when moving from one age category to the next is a notable finding.
This ratio indicates that, all else being equal, patients in a higher
age category are approximately twice as likely to face mortality risks.
This observation is irrespective of whether they receive a heart
transplant or not.

In a broader sense, this implies that, within the confines of the
criteria for inclusion in the study, the need for a heart
transplant--advancing from one age group to the next essentially doubles
the risk of mortality. This is entirely consistent with our
understanding of the aging process and its impact on an individual's
overall health. As one grows older, the body's ability to withstand the
rigors of a medical condition that necessitates a heart transplant
diminishes. The data thus reinforces the notion that age itself is a
critical factor in determining patients outcomes.

In our group's pursuit of identifying the most robust and predictive
model, we turned to the concordance statistics, specifically the
C-statistic, as a guiding metric for a model selection. The C-statistic
serves as a valuable tool for assessing the discriminatory power of
predictive models, aiding in our ability to distinguish their aptitude
for accurately ranking risks and predicting outcomes. Our findings are
as follows:

\textbf{Model 1: Excluding Wait Time}

Our initial model was constructed without considering wait time as a
variable. This decision was rooted in the understanding that wait time
data was only available for patients who ultimately received a heart
transplant, excluding those who did not have the opportunity to undergo
the procedure. The C-statistic for this model, as presented in Table 1,
was calculated to be 0.747. This initial C-statistic provided an
encouraging start for our analysis.

\textbf{Model 2: Including Wait Time for Transplant Recipients}

The second model purpose was to assess the significance of wait time as
a predictor of outcomes but was excluded as an actual model due to the
fact that it only applies to a subgroup of patients who received a heart
transplant. In this instance, the model excluded the control group. The
C-statistic for this model, focusing solely on transplant recipients,
was 0.683, as detailed in Table 2. However, it's important to note that
this model's utility is limited due to its omission of the control
group, which restricts its generalization and practicality.

\textbf{Model 3: Variable Selection and ANOVA Table}

Continuing our goal for the most informative model, we developed a third
model. In this iteration, we sought to explore the influence of the
``accepted year'' variable on predictive capabilities. To make an
informed decision regarding the necessity of including this variable, we
meticulously assessed its impact using an ANOVA table (as shown in Table
4). The analysis provided us with a p-value of 0.1656, exceeding the
common significance level of 0.05. As a result, we concluded that
``accepted year'' could be excluded as a variable in the model.

\textbf{Model 3: Without Accepted Year}

With ``accepted year'' removed as a variable, we obtained a C-statistic
of 0.739 for this refined model, as indicated in Table. The improved
C-statistic underscores the enhanced predictive capabilities of this
model when compare to the previous iteration, which included ``accepted
year'' and had a C-statistic of 0.683

\section{Conclusion:}\label{conclusion}}

In conclusion, our research provides strong support that heart
transplantation has a positive and significant impact on extending the
lives of patients. The data was provided by Stanford Heart Transplant
Study. With the help of a survival analysis tool: Cox Regression model.
The Cox regression was best suited for this study due to the fact that
it is suitable for time-to-event outcomes. In this case, how much longer
does a patient live if given a heart transplant versus those who do not
receive the transplant. In some cases patients post transplant lived an
extra 1-4 years. The best model used to support the data and build the
images was Model 3. Future research could look into which age group had
best survivability post transplant. This could provide healthcare
workers valuable information regarding who should get the heart
transplant if there are patients in different age groups who are waiting
for a new heart and which would benefit the most and survive. As we know
donated organs are not easy to come by and making sure that an organ
such as a heart should go to the best candidate that would live longer
with that new heart. In addition, this analysis would be interesting to
see with more current data and a larger sample size, with more
covariates. For instance, perhaps look into race and sex and how that
affects survivability. Researchers could also compare the results across
different surgery centers, could there be any statistical significance
between having surgery performed at one hospital vs another. In summary,
our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex
interplay between heart transplantation, age and patient outcomes in the
realm of cardiac healthcare.
